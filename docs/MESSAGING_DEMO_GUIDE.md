## Database Verification

### Check Demo Data
```sql
-- View all demo threads

FROM marketplace_threads 
WHERE thread_ref LIKE 'thread_demo_%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View thread participants
SELECT mt.thread_ref, u.name, mtp.role
FROM marketplace_threads mt
JOIN marketplace_thread_participants mtp ON mt.id = mtp.thread_id
JOIN users u ON mtp.user_id = u.id
WHERE mt.thread_ref LIKE 'thread_demo_%'
ORDER BY mt.thread_ref, mtp.role;

-- View message counts per thread
SELECT mt.thread_ref, COUNT(mm.id) as message_count
FROM marketplace_threads mt
LEFT JOIN marketplace_messages mm ON mt.id = mm.thread_id
WHERE mt.thread_ref LIKE 'thread_demo_%'
GROUP BY mt.thread_ref
ORDER BY message_count DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting
