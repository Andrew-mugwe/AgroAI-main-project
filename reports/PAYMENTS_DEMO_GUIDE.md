# Payments Demo Guide

## Overview

The AgroAI Payments Demo CLI provides a simulation environment for testing payment processing across multiple providers before integrating real credentials. This allows developers and stakeholders to understand the payment flow architecture and verify provider integrations work correctly.

## Why This Exists

Before building the full UI payment interface, we need to:
- ‚úÖ Validate payment provider architecture
- ‚úÖ Test payment flows across Stripe, M-Pesa, and PayPal
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate global payment capabilities to investors
- ‚úÖ Ensure consistent API across all providers

## Quick Demo Script (3 Minutes)

### 1. Run Stripe Demo Payment
```bash
go run cmd/demo_payments.go stripe 100 USD
```
**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Payment of 100.00 USD via Stripe processed successfully (stub)
   Transaction ID: stripe_tx_demo
   Status: pending
```

### 2. Run M-Pesa Demo Payment
```bash
go run cmd/demo_payments.go mpesa 500 KES
```
**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Payment of 500.00 KES via M-Pesa processed successfully (stub)
   Transaction ID: mpesa_tx_demo
   Status: pending
```

### 3. Run PayPal Refund
```bash
go run cmd/demo_payments.go --refund paypal 50 EUR
```
**Expected Output:**
```
‚Ü©Ô∏è Refund of 50.00 EUR via PayPal processed successfully (stub)
   Transaction ID: demo_tx_eur_50
```

### 4. Show Global Consistency
```bash
# All providers work the same way
go run cmd/demo_payments.go stripe 25 USD
go run cmd/demo_payments.go mpesa 1000 KES
go run cmd/demo_payments.go paypal 75 EUR
```

## Architecture Benefits

### üîÑ **Unified Interface**
All payment providers implement the same `PaymentProvider` interface:
- `CreatePayment()` - Process new payments
- `RefundPayment()` - Process refunds
- `VerifyPayment()` - Check payment status

### üåç **Global Provider Support**
- **Stripe** - International card payments
- **M-Pesa** - African mobile payments
- **PayPal** - Global digital wallet

### üöÄ **Easy Extension**
Adding new providers is simple:
```go
// Future providers
payments.RegisterProvider("alipay", payments.NewAlipayProvider())
payments.RegisterProvider("applepay", payments.NewApplePayProvider())
payments.RegisterProvider("visa", payments.NewVisaDirectProvider())
```

## CLI Usage

### Basic Payment
```bash
go run cmd/demo_payments.go <provider> <amount> <currency>
```

### Refund Processing
```bash
go run cmd/demo_payments.go --refund <provider> <amount> <currency>
```

### Supported Providers
- `stripe` - Stripe payment processing
- `mpesa` - M-Pesa mobile payments  
- `paypal` - PayPal payment processing

### Supported Currencies
- `USD` - US Dollar
- `EUR` - Euro
- `KES` - Kenyan Shilling
- Any currency code (validation handled by providers)

## Verification

Run the verification script to ensure everything works:
```bash
./scripts/verify-payments.sh
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Run `go vet` on all packages
- ‚úÖ Execute payment service tests
- ‚úÖ Test CLI tool with sample payment

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Phase**: Replace stub implementations with real SDK calls
2. **UI Integration**: Connect CLI logic to React payment components
3. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage
4. **Monitoring**: Add payment analytics and logging
5. **Security**: Implement proper credential management

## Investor Notes
